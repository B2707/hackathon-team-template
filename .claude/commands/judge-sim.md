description: Simulate the judge panel against the current pitch + demo (submission gate)
---

Run a judge simulation against the current state of the pitch and demo.

1. Load `.claude/skills/judge-simulator/SKILL.md` and the pitch-kit knowledge
   files under `.claude/skills/pitch-kit/`.
2. Build the panel from the ACTUAL event rubric (Day-0 Stage 1 extraction).
   Only fall back to `pitch-kit/knowledge/judging-criteria.md` typical weights
   if no rubric has been extracted yet — and say so in the output.
3. Evaluate `docs/pitch/` and the golden-path demo flow. Produce: adversarial
   questions with rebuttals, critical objections, predicted 1–5 scores per
   axis, and the top 3 fixes ranked by expected score impact.
4. SUBMISSION GATE: this command must have been run against the FINAL deck and
   demo before the team submits. If any axis predicts 2 or lower, flag it to
   Bader and sjp explicitly — never silently pass.
